## Drafting a Professional Statement
>### "...developing my skill in Python."
I am a support analyst with over four years providing support of my organization's security and video surveilance systems, with fourteen years of combined experience in telecommunications, from residential,  commercial, and military LAN/WAN network topologies, where I attribute to my greatest strength; problem solving and my commitment to developing my skill in Python.

>### "...my passion for securing the vulnerable..."
Defending vulnerable assets from threat actors is intriguing, espcially when using digital forensics to put a cyber criminal behind bars.  I hope my efforts would lead me into a paramount employer, with a focus in cybersecurity defense, digital forensics and counter human trafficking.  My strength in problem solving, and dedication to developing my skill in Python, paired with my passion for securing the vulnerable, will compliment like-minded organizations; while acomplishing the overall mission.
