## Drafting a Professional Statement
>### "...developing my skill in Python."
I am a support analyst with over four years of providing support for my organization's security and video surveillance systems, with fourteen years of combined experience in telecommunications, from residential,  commercial, and military LAN/WAN network topologies, where I attribute to my greatest strength; problem solving and my commitment to developing my skill in Python. I am passionate about serving those in need, especially the vulnerable.  I value integrity, grit and courage to complete any task handed to me.
>### "...my passion for securing the vulnerable..."
I hold a keen interest in the process of defending vulnerable assets from threat actors, putting a halt to an active attack, then using digital forensics to gather enough evidence to put a cyber criminal behind bars.  My efforts are focused towards an opportunity in cybersecurity defense, digital forensics and counter human trafficking.  My strength in problem solving, and dedication to developing my skill in Python, paired with my passion for securing the vulnerable, will compliment like-minded organizations; making my employer's overall mission my own.
